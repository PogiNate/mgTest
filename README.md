![this mg has seen better days.](http://s0.geograph.org.uk/geophotos/02/44/76/2447663_e6f78008.jpg)

Testing out [Mailgun](http://mailgun.com) and [Heroku](http://heroku.com) to see how awesome they can be together. 

So far: Pretty awesome. 

Unlike my code. It's kinda sad. But this is just a POC app. You can interpret that acronym any way you like.
